All corporate laptops and mobile devices used to access company networks must be fully encrypted using full-disk encryption (FDE) such as BitLocker or FileVault. Employees are prohibited from storing unencrypted company data on personal devices or removable media (USB drives). Any lost or stolen device must be reported to the IT Helpdesk within 24 hours of discovery so that remote wipe protocols can be initiated.
